# Speech Emotion Recognition

There are three classes of features in a speech namely, the lexical features (the vocabulary used), the visual features (the expressions the speaker makes) and the acoustic features (sound properties like pitch, tone, jitter, etc.).

The problem of speech emotion recognition can be solved by analysing one or more of these features. Choosing to follow the lexical features would require a transcript of the speech which would further require an additional step of text extraction from speech if one wants to predict emotions from real-time audio. Similarly, going forward with analysing visual features would require the excess to the video of the conversations which might not be feasible in every case while the analysis on the acoustic features can be done in real-time while the conversation is taking place as weâ€™d just need the audio data for accomplishing our task. Hence, we choose to analyse the acoustic features in this work.
